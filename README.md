# ALTO 3D Printed Desktop 6 Axis Robotic Arm (WIP)

## Introduction
ALTO is the 3D printed robotic arm project I've been working on.

The design was heavily inspired by these following projects:

[Building a 7 Axis Robot from Scratch (By Jeremy Fielding)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSLPefUVeE&ab_channel=JeremyFielding)

[I made a DUMMY ROBOTIC ARM from scratchÔºÅ (By pengzhihui)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSLPefUVeE&ab_channel=JeremyFielding)

Props to them for sharing these amazing projects with all of us!

This robotic arm uses harmonic drives(CSF-11, CSF-8) as reducers and steppers(NEMA17, NEMA14) as motors.

Therefore, the overall precision of the robot is pretty decent for a 3D printed robot, but it is still no match for robotic arm that has fully CNC frames.

The filament I'm using is PLA+, it provides great stiffness and cheap price, but it still has some deformation when big load were apply in TCP, which is acceptable for me.

The controller box has a [STM32F407VG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html"link"), a 12V 100W PSU and a 12V to 5V converter, can be connected to computer via USB and the robotic arm will be identify as a USB device.

I also wrote an API in Python, so that I can simply use Python code to control the robot and combine other sensors more easily.

```python
import alto

alto_6_axis = alto.Alto(6, com_port="COM10")
alto_6_axis.Alto_Operate()
```

## Hardware

All of the component that you need to build the robot is shown in the BOM(bill of material), including the part's name and quantity.

Some of the part were relatively more expensive then other, like harmonic drives.

But I've manage to found cheaper alternative in Aliexpress and Taobao, which is a lot cheaper then the original one.
